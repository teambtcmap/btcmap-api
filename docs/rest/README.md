# BTC Map REST API

The BTC Map REST API provides HTTP-based access to BTC Map data.

## Base URL

All REST API endpoints are relative to the base URL: `https://api.btcmap.org/`

## API Versioning

The API is versioned with the paths `/v2/`, `/v3/`, and `/v4/`. You are always advised to use the latest available version since the old versions will be phased out eventually.

## Available API Versions

- [v4](v4/README.md) - use that, unless you have a very good reason to use an older API.
- [v3](v3/README.md) - used by Android app currently.
- [v2](v2/README.md) - used by Web and iOS apps so we keep it alive for now.
